This is the first completness test.
Account should be created if atm provides same account name and card name (i.e -a martin and -c martin), 
but implemenation of group zabivaka (group id-12) fails to do so.

In this test i am simply trying to create an account with same aaccount name and card file name.

[ {"input":["-p", "%PORT%", "-i", "%IP%", "-a", "martin", "-c", "martin", "-n", "10.30"],"base64":false}]

Oracle Output is exit code '0' with account created but this implementation fails with error 255.

This error is happening because zabivaka implementation tries to look for duplicate input fields
which also catches same account and card file names as duplicate entry which is false so this is a completness bug.
Duplication error is thrown when ever user gives same valeus for different input flags (i,e -a 'same_value' and -c 'same_value').

Possible problem can be found at the line number 102 of atm.py file given for zabivaka groups's implementation.
The logic for duplication in input flags should be different then that written in atm.py line 102.
