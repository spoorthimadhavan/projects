The specification says, regarding card file names:
"""
(each character should match /[_\-\.0-9a-z]/)
"""

Thus an card file name of "-c" should be valid, at least if passed like "-c-c" so it cannot be mistaken as an flag.
This implementation however rejects it (during the deposit operation). This is a bug.
