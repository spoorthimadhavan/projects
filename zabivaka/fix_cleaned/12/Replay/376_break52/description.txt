This is a integrity break implementation.

The attack is done by replaying a previously saved request.

By logging all communication between bank and atm, a pattern was observed, i.e.,
- atm send command to bank
- bank sends response message to atm 


Steps to produce

1. Atm sends -a ted -n 2000.00 to Bank via MITM.
2. Atm sends -a ted -w 500.00 to Bank via MITM. (MITM saves this command along with the atm confirmation).
3. MITM sends the saved command and confirmation to the Bank without involving ATM.

As a result, ted remaining balance is 1000.00 instead of 1500,00
