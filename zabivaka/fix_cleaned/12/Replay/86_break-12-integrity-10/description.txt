This will attack the server using a basic replay attack:
The protocol implementation of group 1 is vunerable to the so-called replay attack, that is that the mitm can save any command from the ATM to the bank and can then just send it two times.
This leads to the command being executed twice and thus the Man in the middle can manipulate the user account when it saves a deposit or withdraw. 
Furthermore, the attacker could potentially get the user amount if he just saves a withdraw of 1 ct and keeps withdrawing until an error is thrown.
Finally, this can be fixed by assigning a unique server-initiaded session-key to each request.
